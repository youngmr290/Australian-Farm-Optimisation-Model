    Animal component of the Blaxter and Clapperton method for CH4 production - linked to the animal DVs.
    This is best linked to the animal DVs because the value varies with the level of feeding which is not known
    if it were connected to the feed-stuff. However, it does require an estimate of the M/D of the feed being consumed
    which is an optimised variable. However, a reasonable approximation is available from the M/D of the feed that
    generated the animal profile.

    Note, in Blaxter and Clapperton 1965 there is an error in table 5 (it should be b=2.37-0.05D (required to make figure 3 work))
    and there is an error CH4 equation derived from table 4 and 5. It should be CH4 (kcal/100kcal feed) = 1.30 + 0.112D + L (2.37 -0.05D).
    In the 2012 tech paper these error were fixed. This is the equation used below.

    Note 2: When they are lactating the ewes intake doubles (or more) and there is a corresponding increase in the
    energy expended on producing milk. So should the extra intake be counted as higher L and therefore reduce
    emissions per unit of intake. Or if there is no change in weight are they still considered to be at maintenance
    and hence high emissions per unit of intake? This is not mentioned in B&C. Currently assuming that level of feeding
    is relative to energy used for maintenance functions and doesn't include the energy used for milk production.
