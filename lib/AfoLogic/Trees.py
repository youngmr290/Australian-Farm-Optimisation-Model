'''

Trees are represented differently in AFO than other land uses. The area of trees on each LMU is a user input. 
This means the area of trees can not be optimised. Optimising the area of trees is complicated because of the
interactions between trees and adjacent paddocks. This means trees can't be represented as a single variable 
because increasing the area of trees needs to be linked to the production of other landuses on the LMU.
To optimise the area of trees would require duplicating all the land uses. 
For example there would need to be a wheat land use and a wheat with trees land use.

def f_adjacent_land_production_scalar():
    '''
    This function calculates an average yield scalar based on the costs (resources competition)
    and benefits (wind protection) of tree plantations.

    The function calculates the average relative production between belts by evaluating the
    indefinite integral of the logistic yield function between belts. The definite integral (area under the curve)
    between belts is then calculated to determine the average relative production between belts.
    
    Only one side of the tree belt receives the benefits
    of wind protection while both sides receive the resource costs.

    The logic used in the function is based on the assumption that the trees are evenly distributed across the LMU and 
    all the costs/benefits of the trees are realised in the LMU where the trees are planted.
    Meaning the costs and benefits are equally distributed over all the rotations on the LMU. 
    This assumption would be incorrect if for example the trees were in a permanant pasture paddock and other parts of the LMU were cropped.
    
    We are also assuming that the belts are far enough apart that the resource competition on the right of one belt is not felt on the left of the next belt.
    Furthermore, the current representation assumes trees have the same relative production impact on crop and pasture.

    Calculates the annualised carbon sequestration cashflow and average biophysical sequestration for 1 hectare of tree plantings over a project duration,
    accounting for growth rates, fuel-related emissions, and carbon credit price.

    The function handles non-linear carbon sequestration by:
    - Estimating net CO₂e sequestered each year after accounting for fuel-related emissions.
    - Converting each year's net sequestration into a dollar value using a real carbon price.
    - Discounting these cashflows over the project duration and annualising them to align with steady-state economic conditions.
    - Separately calculating the average annual net CO₂e sequestered (in kg/ha/year) for biophysical reporting in AFO.

    This distinction ensures the financial benefit is derived from time-weighted cashflows, while the biophysical metric reflects
    the average sequestration rate. These are **not interchangeable**, since sequestration is not constant over time.
    
    Notes:
    - Sequestration is estimated using values derived from FullCAM, scaled by regional and land unit multipliers.
    - Under the Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) scheme, fuel use that generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to maintain or manage vegetation does reduce the net amount of carbon sequestered and therefore reduces the number of ACCUs issued.
    - A risk of reversal buffer is applied to account for permanence uncertainty (e.g., fire, drought).
    - Income is calculated only if carbon credits are included.
    - This is assuming that the financial values in AFO are in real terms & will remain constant. In other words the opportunity cost of forgone
      agricultural production will be the same every yr in real terms. Hence the carbon price is also specfied in real terms.
