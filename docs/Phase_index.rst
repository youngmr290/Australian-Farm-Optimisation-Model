Crop and pasture system
========================

In this section a brief overview of the crop and pasture system represented in AFO will be provided, followed
by a detailed description of the phase module. Cropping is often a large component of
broadacre farming. Crops are primarily established with a goal of harvesting and selling the grain for
human or animal consumption. However, crops can also be used as a fodder feed for farm livestock. As
described in the rotation chapter, the rotation phases specify both the current land use and the land
use history. Pasture phases are also a large component of broadacre farming. Pastures are often included in the rotation
to provide a break from cropping, which can rejuvenate soil conditions, provide disease and pest management and provide
a cheap feed source for livestock.
The phase module generates the income and cost of each rotation phase (crop and pasture) on each LMU based
on the crop yield, fertiliser and chemical requirements, residual management, commodity prices, fees
and levies.

.. note:: Information regarding pasture growth and consumption is generated and documented in the pasture module (In
    the Feed supply section).
