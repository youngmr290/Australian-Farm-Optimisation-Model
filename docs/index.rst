Welcome to Australian Farm Optimisation Model's documentation
==============================================================

AFO is a whole farm bio-economical optimisation model based around an Australian farm system.

AFO superseded a whole farm model called MIDAS. The model represents the biology and economics of an Australian farm system
in a linear programming framework. The model has been designed so that the user has the ability to customise
the level of detail included. For example, the user can control the how year-to-year variation
is included, how risk is represented, what rotations are included, etc.

The model is designed such that it is very flexible and hence it should facilitate any desired developments.
We are open to collaboration with others but ask that any model improvements made are shared back via github.
