Short-term decisions and the impact of current business position on future decisions
=========================================================================================
To make AFO more useful for individual farm optimisation and short term decision making
the multi-period framework was developed. The multi-period version of AFO represents the
starting position of an actual farm with the optimisation over the period of the sequence.
The final year of the sequence is treated as a single year equilibrium. This final year
equilibrium ensures that selling all the assets in the final year is not the optimum solution.
The MP framework is a repurposed version of the season sequence mode.

The multi-period framework allows users to examine short term decisions such as not mating a class
of stock for a single year or how best to respond to short-term price fluctuations. It also allows users to
identify the optimal transition from a farms current structure to the optimum. For example, if the current farm
had 1500 stock but the optimum is to have 5000, the MP model will identify the most efficient way to
build stock numbers and over how many years it should be done.
