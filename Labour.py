    Calculates labour supply, labour cost and supervision requirements.

    To capture the dynamics of labour, the year is broken into periods :cite:p:`RN89`. The supply of
    labour in each period by each labour source is calculated, and the labour required by each farm
    activity is determined and assigned to the given period/s.

    The amount of time available to work in each period depends on the hours that each worker works
    each day. Labour can be supplied by three sources:

    #. Casual staff – In the unrestricted model casual staff can come and go at any time throughout the
       year as the model chooses. However, the user has the power to fix the number of casual staff employed
       during each part of the year.

    #. Permanent staff – Permanent staff work on the property all year.

    #. Manager staff (commonly the farm owner) – The farm manager works on the property all year. They control
       the overall farm plan and thus spend a fixed amount of time each quarter for farm planning, learning,
       record-keeping, purchasing and selling, and other office work.

    The timeliness and labour intensity of seeding and harvest means staff often work longer days during
    those periods :cite:p:`RN89`. To accommodate this, the user specifies the hours worked by each type of
    staff on the weekdays and weekends for both standard periods and seeding and harvest periods.

    Casual and permanent staff both require a certain amount of supervision from the farm manager. The
    proportion of supervision is specified separately for seeding and harvesting periods and all other
    labour periods. This is because during seeding and harvest it is likely that less supervision is
    required. Casual staff are generally less experienced and/or acquainted with the farm operation than
    permanent staff and thus require more supervision.

    The farm manager and permanent staff have four weeks of holiday each year. The holiday timing is flexible (optimised
    by AFO). This is because managers and permanent staff tend to have a less defined schedule, often taking multiple
    smaller holidays during the year or returning to the farm during holidays to check on things.
    Additionally, in AFO, permanent and casual staff require supervision from the manager which means if the manager
    is forced to take their holidays in one big chunk the model may not be able to access labour resulting in randomness
    if the period dates change.
    All labour sources take days off for Christmas, New Year’s Day, and Easter. Permanent staff are
    also allocated a certain number of sick days per year. The user has the ability to alter the length
    and timing of worker leave

    Casual staff are paid on a per hour basis and the manager and permanent staff are paid an annual wage.
    All labour costs include superannuation and workers’ compensation.
