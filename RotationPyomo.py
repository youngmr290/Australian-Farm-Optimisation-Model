def f_con_rotation_between(params, model):
    '''
    Creates the constraint between history provided at the end of the year and the history required at the beginning
    of the year for each rotation phase on each LMU.

    The rotation constraints are to ensure that the rotation phases that are selected in the optimisation can
    be arranged into an actual rotation. All phases except the continuous rotations require at least one other
    phase. Eg. a canola(z)-wheat(w) rotation would be generated from 2 phases  Y Y N E z and Y Y E N w. To represent
    this requires ensuring that each rotaion phase selected has a preceding phase that has landuses in the same
    order as the target rotation phase (except for year 0). This is called the history required and history required.

    Transfer of rotation phase within a year.

    The phase area selected in each phase_period must be at least the area selected in the previous period and the

    earlier selection).

    The transfer of the phases selected in the parent weather-year to the child weather-years is achieved in
    the same manner as the transfers of stock, pasture and cashflow with 2 differences:

        a.	the inclusion of v_phase_increment which allows extra area of a phase to be selected in each node.
        b.	the constraint is equal-to rather than less-than. This is necessary to cover a situation in which the cashflow parameter of v_phase_increment is earning money. In this situation the model would be unbounded with a less-than constraint.
