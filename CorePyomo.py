    Ensures that the seeding requirements for each rotation phase selected can be met by the capacity of the

    Links seeding requirement with machinery sowing activity (which accounts for machinery use and labour
    needed to sow pasture).
    No p5 set in the constraint because model can optimise sowing time (can only optimise within the periods provided eg
    dry sowing activity only provides sowing capacity before the break).

    p_sow_prov links k and p5 so that:

        #. dry sown landuses are sown before the break.
        #. pasture is sown in the correct p5 periods based on the inputted reseeding date.
        #. wet sown crops are sown after the break of season.

    v_seeding_machdays is bound in con_seed_period_days to ensure that the correct days of seeding are provided in
    each p7 and p5 period.

    Notes:

        #. The requirement for seeding is based on v_phase_increment rather than v_phase_area
        #. a phase can only be sown in the phase_period for which the phase_increment is selected. If there is
           insufficient seeding capacity then the selection of v_phase_increment must be made in a later phase_period.

    Note: this is an equals to constraint to stop the model sowing without a landuse so it can get poc and crop

def f_objective(model):
    '''
    The objective of the model is to maximise expected utility (total satisfaction). In the case of risk neutral,
    expected utility is equivalent to expected profit, meaning that the optimal farm management plan is that which
    maximises farm profit. In the case of risk aversion, utility increases at a diminishing rate as profit increases.
    Thus, when farm profit is low an extra dollar is more valuable than an extra dollar when farm profit is high.
    This means, to some degree, the optimal farm management plan aims to reduce profit variation (i.e. increase
    profit in poor years at the cost of reduced profit in the good years). For example, if the crop and stock
    enterprise on the modelled farm are similar but grain prices are more volatile, then risk aversion
    will shift resources towards the stock enterprise to reduce risk (profit variation).

    The expected return used to calculate utility includes the net cash flow for a given price and weather scenario,
    minus a cost to represent a minimum
    return on operating costs incurred (MINROE), minus the cost of depreciation, and minus the opportunity cost on the
    farm assets (total value of all assets times the discount rate  (to ensure that the assets generate a minimum ROA)).
    MINROE and asset opportunity costs are discussed in more detail in the finance section, and their inclusion is
    controlled by the user.

    Constant absolute risk-aversion (CARA) and constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) are two well known utility functions.
    Both have been previously used in stochastic farm modelling (see :cite:p:`KINGWELL1994, kingwell1996`) and both
    methods are included in AFO (note: alternative utility functions can easily be added).
    CARA is a negative exponential curve: :math:`U = 1-exp(-a*x)` where :math:`U` is utility, :math:`a` is the
    Pratt-Arrow coefficient of absolute risk aversion and x is the return to management and capital.
    The Pratt-Arrow coefficient is a user input that controls the level of risk aversion. :cite:p:`KINGWELL1994`
    used two levels: 0.000 003 and 0.000 005 to represent moderate and high levels risk-aversion.
    CRRA is a power function denoted by: :math:`U = W^(1-R) / (1-R)` where :math:`U` is utility, :math:`W` is terminal
    wealth and :math:`R` is the relative risk aversion coefficient.
    The relative risk aversion coefficient is a user defined input that controls the level of risk aversion.
    :cite:p:`kingwell1996` used values within the range of 0.1 to 3.0 to represent low to high levels of risk-aversion.

    Both methods have limitations, most of which can be minimised if the modeler is aware.
    A CARA specification implies there are no wealth effects on a farmer's income and price security decisions.
    In practice, the CARA specification means that the farmer's risk management
    decisions, particularly in favourable states of nature (e.g. good weather-years with high commodity prices)
    when a farmer's wealth is boosted, will be different and more concerned with income stability than those
    that would arise with a CRRA specification. The limitation of the CRRA method is that it can not handle a negative
    terminal state. Additionally, because CRRA is impacted by terminal wealth, MINROE and asset opportunity cost
    will affect the impact of risk aversion, which is not technically correct because these are not real costs incurred
    by the farmer.

    Due to AFO's size, linear programming has been used to improve solving efficiency and accuracy.
    Therefore, the non-linear utility functions are represented by a number of linear segments, a common
    linear programming technique called piecewise representation. When doing risk aversion analysis the
    user must ensure that the line segments capture the expected spread of terminal wealth.
