# The Australian Farm Optimisation Model (AFO)
Whole Farm Bioeconomic Optimisation Model

The base version (steady state linear program) is operational and the developers are working
on adding seasonal variation which will provide the user the ability to convert the model into
a discrete stochastic program (DSP).

AFO superseded the whole farm model called MIDAS. The model represents the biology and economics of an Australian farm system.
We are happy to colaborate with others who may like to use this model with the condition that all improvements are added back to this repository
leading to an improved model.
The model is designed such that it is very flexible and hence it should facilitate any desired developments.
