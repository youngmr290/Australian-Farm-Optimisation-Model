# The Australian Farm Optimisation Model (AFO)
Whole Farm Bioeconomic Optimisation Model

AFO superseded the whole farm model called MIDAS. The model represents the biology and economics of an Australian farm system.
AFO has been widely used in the R&D space for a wide range of applications including on-farm amangement guidance, 
policy guidance and research prioritisation. We are happy to collaborate with others who may like to use this model with the condition that all improvements are added back to this repository
leading to an improved model.
The model is designed such that it is very flexible and hence it should facilitate any desired developments.

This raw version of AFO is rather complex. However, for those looking to quickly apply AFO, Farm Optimisation Group
have developed an online version that can be accessed via a minimal yearly subscription. See: https://hub.farmoptimisation.com/.
