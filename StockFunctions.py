    Generates the relationship between diet NV and, FOO & diet quality (in each feed period and weather-year).

    The function generates multiple discrete data points from which FOO & diet M/D can be predicted from diet NV by interpolation.
    This relationship is required because the same nutritive value can be achieved with a varying combination of FOO and DMD.
    The combination selected affects the animal requirements because:

        #. FOO affects the energy requirement associated with walking to find feed.
        #. M/D affects the efficiency of utilising energy for maintenance and production.

    The range from lowest NV to highest NV is associated with increasing FOO & DMD inputs across the j0 axis and then
    increasing supplementary feeding from the input level up to ad-lib.

    The mei returned from this function is nv for a potential intake of 1 (nv = mei * PI). The nv is scaled
    for the actual PI outside this function.

    Calculation of dam conception using CSIRO equation system

    Conception is the change in the numbers of animals in each slice of e & b as a proportion of the numbers
    in the NM slice (e[0]b[0]). The adjustment of the actual numbers occurs in f1_period_end_nums().
    This function calculates the change in the proportions (the total should add to 0)

    The general approach is to calculate the probability of conception greater than or equal to 1,2,3 foetuses
    Probability is calculated from a sigmoid relationship based on relative size * relative condition at joining
    The estimation of cumulative probability is scaled by a factor that varies with day of year that changes with
    litter size & latitude.
    The probability is an estimate of the number of dams carrying that number in the third trimester (or birth).
    Some dams conceive (and don't return to service) but don't carry to the third trimester
    due to abortion, this is taken into account.
    The values are altered by a sensitivity analysis on scanning percentage
    Conception (proportion of dams that are dry) and litter size (number of foetuses per pregnant dam) can be controlled for relative economic values

    :param cf:
    :param cb1: GrazPlan parameter stating the probability of conception with different number of foetuses.

    Calculation of dam conception using CSIRO equation system

    Conception is the change in the numbers of animals in each slice of e & b as a proportion of the numbers
    in the NM slice (e[0]b[0]). The adjustment of the actual numbers occurs in f1_period_end_nums()
    This function calculates the change in the proportions (the total should add to 0)

    The general approach is to calculate the probability of conception less than or equal to 1,2,3 foetuses
    similar to f_conception_cs() except LMAT is "less than" and probability is calculated from a back transformed
    calculation with linear and quadratic terms.
    The calculation includes terms for LW at joining, Age at joining and LW change during joining.
    The estimation of cumulative probability as fitted in the LMAT trial is scaled by a dau=y of year factor, this
    is derived from the factor used for the GrazPlan adjustment but requires calculating in this function.
    The probability is an estimate of the number of dams carrying that number of young to birth if mated for the
    number of cycles assessed in the trial. The parameters could be altered to represent a single cycle however
    this correction hasn't been made (as of Apr 2022) and the adjustment is made in this function.
    Some dams conceive (and don't return to service) but don't carry to birth (the third trimester)
    due to abortion during pregnancy, this is taken into account.
    #todo The conversion of the prediction from 2 cycles back to one cycle doesn't include this loss
    #which then increases the proportion of empty ewes and reduces the expected RR.
    #The correction has been removed for now.
    The values are altered by a sensitivity analysis on scanning percentage
    Conception (proportion of dams that are dry) and litter size (number of foetuses per pregnant dam) can
    be controlled for relative economic values

    :param cf: Includes parameter for number of ewes that implant but don't retain to birth (the 3rd trimester).

    :param lwc: Liveweight change of the dam during the generator period in g/hd/d.
    :param age: age of dam mid-period in days. Indexed for p. The i axis can be non-singleton

    of the next repro cycle (prejoining) should be the weighted average of all the animals excluding drys.
    Because we don't know the animals are actually sold (since pyomo optimises this) we need to leave the
    main numbers variable untouched so we temporarily make the adjustment in this function. In the inputs the user
    inputs the expected number of drys that will be retained. In this function we scale the numbers of drys
    by that amount so that the new animal at the start of next prejoining reflects if drys were sold or retained.
    E.g. if drys were sold the prejoining animal would be a little bit lighter (because drys tend to weigh more).

    An extra step occurs if generating for stubble. For stubble the function selects the starting animal for the
    next period based on animal liveweight compare to the stubble trial. The animals that have te closest lw
    to the paddock trial become the starting animals next period.

    but t[2] animals are in t[0] (retained) slice in the previous dvp therefore they do not incur the classing cost.

    The best solution we could come up with is to base husb triggers off the retained slice unless the trigger is ==0

    Mostly when a dvp is 0 days long (clashes with another dvp) we want it to have 0 production (e.g. 0 mei).
    This is how it works in the p2v function. However, in some cases (numbers and ffcfw) we want values in the
    0 day dvps because we need the animals to transfer to the next dvp. ffcfw is used in the numbers distribution
    so it needs numbers in case season start or condense dvp clash with another dvp.

    ffcfw needs to allow distribution to work correctly. So the condense dvp is always first in a clash (this is

    """Distribute animals between periods when the animals are changing on the period junction. This change can
    be either 1. condensing at prejoining when animals are 'condensed' from the final number of LW profiles back to
    the initial number or 2. averaging animals at season start when weights at the end of all the seasons are
    averaged to become the start weight for the next season.

    The animals are distributed to the 2 nearest neighbours, rather than a distribution across all destination LWs.
    The aim is that the average weight of the animals in the next period is equal to the average weight at the
    end of this period. However, this is only possible if the source weight being distributed is between the
    lowest and highest destination weights.

    If the weight is above the highest destination weight then the weight is rounded down & the extra weight is
    effectively lost. If the weight is below the lowest weight then that animal is not transferred to the next
    period and the animal is effectively lost.

    When the distribution is for condensing/pre-joining the destination weights are ffcfw_end for the condensed slices (w9).
    This is the condensed values of ffcfw_end (of this DVP) rather than ffcfw_start (of the next DVP) because ffcfw_start
    includes the averaging of LW that occurs as part of f_period_start_prod when the period is prejoin.
    Clustering based on the condensed weights of lw_start (after averaging across the b1 & e1 axes) would mean
    that the clustering is occurring based on the proportion of animals in the b1 & e1 axes in the generator
    (which are based on those animals following the same nutrition profile (H, M or L for that class)), whereas
    they may have been differentially managed in the matrix, hence the requirement to distribute based on ffcfw_end.
    The effect if the groups are clustered (i.e. not scanned) is to keep the heavier singles with the heavier twins,
    rather than distribute the heavy twins with the average singles (which might have a more similar weight).
    If this didn't occur the LW distribution would allow defacto ‘scanning’ through LW distribution. Although
    differential management based on LW can be done in practice, in reality there is a distribution of weight
    (within each class-dry,single,twin) so the split would be imprecise, whereas in the generator all the animals
    of a class (D,S,Tw) are all the same weight (for a given nutrition profile), so the generator could split
    them accurately for BTRT based on LW.

    Note: A distribution of liveweight at the end of a period would be technically correct i.e. a given class of
    animal that are offered a given feed supply for a period of time will result in spread of final weights, even
    if all the animals started at the same weight. However, in AFO it only results in a single weight. A fix could
    be to add a normal distribution to the final weights, however, this would significantly complicate debugging
    because it would make following a class of animals between periods very difficult.
