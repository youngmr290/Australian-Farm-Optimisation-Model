Crop grazing is an option that allows sheep to graze green crop, typically from June until August
however this range can be altered in the inputs. Green crops
have a higher energy content than green pasture and grow more erect allowing for easier grazing,
meaning a lower crop FOO is required to meet the livestock needs. However, a yield and stubble penalty is
associated with this activity. Trials have recorded varying yield penalties from -15% to +15%, but the
consensus is that the yield penalty is minimal if the crop is grazed early and lightly. The level of the yield
penalty is an input which can be easily changed.

def f_cropgraze_DM(r_vals=None, total_DM=False):
    '''
    Calculates the dry matter (DM) available for grazing on crop paddocks and the total DM used to calculate relative
    availability.

    The total DM is calculated from the initial DM plus growth minus the consumption. The initial DM is an inputted amount
    which represents germination and first growth over an establishing period. No grazing can occur during the establishing
    period. After the establishing period, the crop grows at an inputted rate per day and a proportion of this growth
    becomes available for consumption. Total DM (used to calc relative availability) is calculated assuming that all
    the crop available for grazing is consumed. Depending on grazing management this may underestimate DM
    however, crop grazing has high availability at low DM levels (due to upright growth) so this limitation is likely
    to be minor.

    If DM is not consumed in the period it grows it is transferred to the following feed period. Currently, it
    doesn't incur a growth rate (e.g. 1t that isn't consumed in fp0 transfers to 1t in fp1). A possible improvement would
    be to include growth in the transfer activity.

    Crop growth rate is an input for each feed period, LMU and land use.
    There are two main limitations of the representation:

        #. Impacts of rotation are not included in the estimation of crop growth.
        #. Growth rate is independent of selected grazing management (e.g. if the crop isn't grazed in the
           first period then the subsequent growth rate does not change).

    Both DM parameters are built with a z8z9 axis. This is because provision of crop grazing is hooked up to the
    seeding activity which is not transferred to future periods and thus doesn't uncluster but seeding provides
    crop DM in future periods which may be in nodes. Therefore, a z8z9 axis is required so that seeding in z[0] provides
    crop grazing in z[1] and other children.

    P5 axis is required to represent sowing time. Sowing time impacts the DM provided in each p6 period.

    :param total_DM: boolean when set to True calculates the total crop DM used to calculate relative availability.
