    """According to the Australian Feeding Standards (Freer et al 2007) an animal that is gaining weight then
       losing weight is less efficient than an animal that is maintaining weight on a constant diet. Therefore,
       switching between a high quality diet and a low quality diet to maintain weight requires more MJ of ME
       than using a consistent medium quality diet.
       This is represented by scaling the MEI that is above that required to meet the animal target with the
       animal target being based on the mid-point of the feed pool (hence effective mei varies for each feed
       pool (v) because the target profile varies between pools).
       This would be important to represent in the model for animals with a liveweight target set to reduce MEI and
       maximise SR. This occurs when animals are being retained on-farm over summer, and extra MEI with weight
       gain would not increase profit. However, for animals that are being fed to gain weight to achieve a target
       for turnoff, better quality feed with increased weight gain would increase profit due to faster growth with
       earlier turnoff.
       In situations where a animal decision variable with faster growth would be selected, if it were available, it
       would be better to not represent the reduced efficiency, whereas if that decision variable would not be selected
       then the reduction should be represented.
       Working conclusion: All feedstuffs should go through f_effective_mei. However, the highest nv pool should not
       be reduced, even if the feed quality is greater than then animal demand, on the assumption that the target for
       these animals is growth and that faster growth would be better.
       The exception to the above is supplement because the quantity of supplement can be controlled so as not to
       result in LWG followed by a period of LWL.

    :param dmi: value or array - Dry matter intake of the feed decision variable (kg).
    :param md: value or array - M/D of the feed (MJ of ME / kg of DM).
    :param threshold_f: value or array - Diet quality (ME/Vol) required by animals (with a f axis). Below the threshold: effective m/d == m/d
    :param confinement_inc: boolean stating if the confinement feed pool is included.
    :param ri: value or array, optional (1.0) - Relative intake of the feed (quality and quantity).
    :param eff_above: value or array, optional (0.5) - Efficiency that energy is used if above required quality, and
                      animals are gaining then losing weight.

    If inputs are provided in arrays then they must be broadcastable.

    Adjust FOO for measurement method.

    Depending on the region, FOO can be measured differently. For example, in WA when measuring FOO
    the pasture is cut to ground level using a scalpel versus NSW where it is cut at a higher level
    with shears. This results in the same amount of feed being valued at a higher FOO in WA.
    The FOO is adjusted in this function to the method which is used in the livestock production equations.
    This was the shears method but now appears to be total above ground biomass which is as used in WA.

    FOO only needs to be adjusted for the intake equations. It does not need to be adjusted for the pasture
    growth calculations because the FOO in the inputs is consistent with the FOO in the pasture grwoth calcualtions.

    The minimum grazing limit FOO level (level which grazing can not occur below) is specified in FOO units
    of the livestock grazing equations (this value is removed from available FOO in f_ra().
    The base level in the pasture grazing intensity calculations is in units of FOO that have been used to define
