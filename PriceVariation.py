Generate price scenario scalars.

Price scalars have two main purposes:

    #. To account for variations in the price received for a given year due to external market conditions (c1 axis).
    #. To account for variation in prices due to season type.

Notwithstanding weather variation, agricultural commodity price is a major source of farm risk
and must be represented when including farmer risk attitude (see the model objective documentation in CorePyomo for
information about the representation of risk aversion). For example, if the grain price is more variable
than livestock prices, it may be optimal for a risk averse farmer to have a higher livestock focus
because it will reduce variation in the level of income. Price variation is
approximated in AFO using user defined number of price states for meat, wool and grain.
The price states were determined from a multivariate price distribution so that correlation between commodities
was captured.


Generation of discrete price states:

The need to form discrete approximations of a continuous distributions is a necessary requirement for developing a
discrete stochastic programming model of farm management responses to price and weather-year states.
By their nature, discrete stochastic programming models cannot consider
all possible price states as described by continuous distributions.  Rather continuous variables such as price
need to be approximated by discrete states.

In AFO, the user inputs the average price for each commodity. This is then adjusted by a price state scalar
which returns the price of each commodity in each discrete price state. The price state
scalars and their probability are calculated by fitting a multivariate normal distribution to historical price variation
scalars. A multivariate distribution is used so that correlations between commodities are accurately
represented in the resulting price states. The price variation scalars are calculated using two different methods. Both
methods use historical price data for each commodity.
Note: Grain and wool prices are better represented by
a log-normal distribution (e.g. :cite:p:`kingwell1996`) thus before fitting the distribution grain and wool data undergo
a log transformation.

For method 1, the weekly price scalars are calculated by dividing the CPI adjusted historical prices by the
average price for the series. For method 2, the weekly price scalars are calculated by dividing the CPI adjusted historical
prices by the medium term moving average. A moving average is used to detrend the price series (remove long term price trends).
The logic behind method 2 is that the price states represented in AFO serve the purpose of capturing yearly price
variation (i.e variations around the expected price for that year). Thus, including long term price trends may overestimate
variation within a given year.

The multivariate normal distribution resulting from either method 1 or 2, is then summarised into discrete
states by dividing up the probability density distribution and calculating the probability (area under the curve)
and weighted average price of each section of the distribution.
The price at each point is compared to the average to determine the magnitude
of the scalar.

To reduce model size and simplify input calibration, all meat classes (lamb, shipper,
mutton, etc) received the same meat price scalar. The same thing happens for classes of wool and types of grain.
This simplification should not compromise the accuracy of the results because subclasses of a given commodity
tend to have a high correlation (e.g. between 2000 and 2021 the correlation between light lamb and mutton was 96%).
A further simplification was not to include price variation
for input costs because input costs tend to vary less and therefore the additional model size
was not justified. The resulting assumptions are that all animal classes are 100% correlated,
all wool microns are 100% correlated, all grains are 100% correlated and all input commodities have no variation.
If these assumptions become limiting it is possible to add the extra detail in the price generation.

The c1 axis is averaged for both the asset constraint and the working capital. This saves space without losing
much/any information.

    '''
    Using the mean and covariance of multiple variables (currently 3 - wool, meat & grain) a multivariate normal 
    distribution is fitted. The distribution is used to return the PDF (probability density function)of different prices. 
    
    Interpretation of the PDF:
    On its own the value returned from a PDF function doesnt mean much. If you were to plot the whole PDF the area under
    the curve would equal 1. 
    It is impossible to provide the probability of obtaining one singular price because there are infinite possibilities.
    Therefore interpreting a PDF is essentially like saying "what is the probability of a price between x and y".
    The answer is equal to the area under the graph. Therefore, in the following code we generate the pdf for a large number
    of prices and then determine the probability of a price within each little chunk.
     
    To generate the PDF for a range of values required builiding an array with the desired number of slices.
    The min and max value for each axis is determined by the 3rd standard deviation. This should capture 99.9% of the distribution.
    In the post processing the probability of each chunk is added together to provide a given number of price states.
    
    Note: This is inflexible - if you want to add more variables into the distribution you will need to add code.
