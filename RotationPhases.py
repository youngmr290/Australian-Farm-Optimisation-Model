"""

This module reads in rotation information that has been generated from RotGeneration.py and manipulates
it to produce the rotation parameters.

The flexible and detailed handling of rotation decisions allows the representation of paddock history on the
current landuse to be represented as well as the tactical and strategical decisions that accompany rotation. Such
as delaying the choice of rotation phase at the start of the growing season and changing rotation phase later in the
growing season. Or even adding a summer crop if the season permits.

    '''
    Adjust v_phase param for v_phase_change_increase.

    v_phase_change_increase must incur the requirement to date for labour and cash for the phase.
    This is making the assumption that any jobs carried out, and any expenditure
    (fertiliser or chemical applied) will be applied even though the phase is selected later in the year.
    This stops the optimisation selecting the phase in the last node and receiving the income without
    incurring any costs.

    Note 1: Yield and stubble do not require increment params because it is not possible to harvest a
    rotation before the rotation is selected.

    Note 2: labour gets handled slightly different. Labour that occurs in previous labour periods before the season
        period when v_phase_change_increase is selected must be completed in the first labour period when the phase is selected.

    Note 3: f_v_phase_increment_adj starts counting from the start of season but there are no phase costs/labour between until
        after the break for each season otherwise costs would get double counted in
        medium/late breaks where phases are carried over past the start of the season to provide dry pas and stubble area.
